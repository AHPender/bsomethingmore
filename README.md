##Homework
I know we have all have a lot going on but I thought it might be a good idea for us to get to know what our goals are for this project. This homework will also be helpful with the git workflow (pulls, branching, commit, push, merge requests, and issues etc). It would be awesome if we could do this by the next time we meet, but I understand that might not be possible with our schedules.

1. Go to the git hub [bsomethingmore](https://github.com/AsaSmith/bsomethingmore) repo and create an issue. Make the title your name.
2. Pull/Fetch the most current repo (merge with your master if necessary)
3. Create feature branch, checkout feature branch
4. Open the README.md file
5. Add your name as an h3 below the "Goals"
6. Below your name write a few sentences explaining what your goals are or what you're hoping to get out of this project
7. Save file, stage changes, commit changes(add your issue \# to your commit message e.g. 'homework complete \#2'), push branch
8. Any questions, use the slack channel
9. Have fun!
